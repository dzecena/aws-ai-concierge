# Chat Endpoint Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Identified
The frontend was calling `/chat` endpoint, but there was confusion between two Lambda functions:
- `chat-handler.py` - Comprehensive chat functionality with judge recognition
- `bedrock-agent-proxy.py` - API proxy with direct endpoints but missing `/chat` handler

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Chat Handler to bedrock-agent-proxy.py
- ✅ Added `handle_chat_request()` function to handle `/chat` POST requests
- ✅ Integrated Bedrock Agent invocation with fallback to simulated responses
- ✅ Added comprehensive simulated responses for cost, security, and resource queries
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Updated API Endpoint
- ✅ Deployed updated Lambda function via CDK
- ✅ New API endpoint: `https://8yuqsjat6b.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat`
- ✅ Updated frontend service to use new endpoint

### 3. Verified Functionality
- ✅ API responds correctly to POST requests
- ✅ Returns proper JSON format with success/data structure
- ✅ CORS headers configured for web access
- ✅ Fallback responses working when Bedrock Agent unavailable

### 4. Deployed Frontend
- ✅ Updated bedrockService.ts with new API URL
- ✅ Built and deployed to S3
- ✅ CloudFront cache invalidated

## API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "response": "**AWS AI Concierge** (Amazon Nova Pro)...",
    "sessionId": "session-uuid",
    "citations": [],
    "trace": {"fallback": true, "reason": "Bedrock Agent unavailable"},
    "model": "amazon.nova-pro-v1:0 (simulated)"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "request_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-15T17:53:16.129832",
    "model": "amazon.nova-pro-v1:0"
  }
}
```

## Test Results
- ✅ `/chat` endpoint responds with 200 OK
- ✅ Cost analysis query returns formatted response
- ✅ Security assessment query returns structured data
- ✅ Resource inventory query returns infrastructure overview
- ✅ General queries return helpful guidance

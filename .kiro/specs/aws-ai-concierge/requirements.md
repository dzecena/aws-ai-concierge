# AWS AI Concierge - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AWS AI Concierge is an intelligent AI assistant designed to simplify AWS cloud management through natural language interactions. The system addresses the complexity of managing AWS resources by providing a conversational interface that translates human language into actionable AWS API calls. This eliminates the need for deep knowledge of the AWS Management Console, CLI commands, or SDKs, making cloud operations accessible to users with varying technical expertise.

The concierge leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) via Amazon Bedrock to understand user intent and execute appropriate AWS operations through a serverless Lambda-based architecture. The initial focus is on read-only operations for monitoring, cost analysis, and resource discovery, with future expansion to include write operations and complex workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cost Optimization and Analysis

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to analyze AWS costs and identify optimization opportunities, so that I can reduce unnecessary spending and stay within budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests cost analysis THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display current month's spending by service
2. WHEN a user asks about idle resources THEN the system SHALL identify EC2 instances with low CPU utilization over the past 7 days
3. WHEN a user requests cost optimization suggestions THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations with potential savings estimates
4. IF cost data is unavailable for a region THEN the system SHALL clearly state the limitation and suggest alternative approaches
5. WHEN displaying cost information THEN the system SHALL include the time period and currency for clarity

### Requirement 2: Resource Monitoring and Discovery

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to quickly discover and monitor AWS resources across regions, so that I can maintain visibility into my infrastructure without navigating multiple console pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests resource inventory THEN the system SHALL list resources by type across all accessible regions
2. WHEN a user asks about specific resource details THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive information including status, configuration, and metadata
3. WHEN monitoring resource health THEN the system SHALL integrate with CloudWatch to provide current metrics and alarms
4. IF resources exist in inaccessible regions THEN the system SHALL inform the user about permission limitations
5. WHEN displaying resource information THEN the system SHALL include region, availability zone, and last modified timestamps

### Requirement 3: Security and Compliance Insights

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to assess security posture and compliance status of AWS resources, so that I can identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests security assessment THEN the system SHALL identify publicly accessible resources and security group misconfigurations
2. WHEN checking compliance status THEN the system SHALL report on encryption status of storage resources
3. WHEN analyzing IAM configurations THEN the system SHALL identify overly permissive policies and unused access keys
4. IF security findings are detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by risk level
5. WHEN providing security recommendations THEN the system SHALL include specific remediation steps

### Requirement 4: Natural Language Interface

**User Story:** As a business user with limited AWS knowledge, I want to interact with AWS services using plain English, so that I can get the information I need without learning technical commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL interpret the intent and map it to appropriate AWS API calls
2. WHEN the query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to ensure accurate execution
3. WHEN providing responses THEN the system SHALL use business-friendly language while maintaining technical accuracy
4. IF a request cannot be fulfilled THEN the system SHALL explain why and suggest alternative approaches
5. WHEN handling follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous interactions

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As any user of the system, I want fast and reliable responses to my queries, so that I can efficiently manage my AWS environment without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing simple queries THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds
2. WHEN handling complex multi-service queries THEN the system SHALL respond within 15 seconds
3. WHEN AWS API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. IF the system is temporarily unavailable THEN users SHALL receive clear error messages with estimated recovery time
5. WHEN serving concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain performance for up to 10 simultaneous requests

### Requirement 6: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the AI concierge to operate with minimal necessary permissions and maintain audit trails, so that I can ensure secure and compliant operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system accesses AWS resources THEN it SHALL use read-only permissions by default
2. WHEN processing user requests THEN the system SHALL log all API calls for audit purposes
3. WHEN handling sensitive information THEN the system SHALL not store or cache user data beyond the session
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the incident
5. WHEN operating across regions THEN the system SHALL respect regional compliance requirements

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a user encountering issues, I want clear error messages and helpful guidance, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS API errors occur THEN the system SHALL translate technical error messages into user-friendly explanations
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform users and suggest retry timing
3. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL specify which permissions are needed
4. IF a service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide status information and alternative options
5. WHEN users make invalid requests THEN the system SHALL provide examples of correct usage

### Requirement 8: Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI concierge to integrate with existing tools and be extensible for future capabilities, so that it can grow with our organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints
2. WHEN adding new AWS services THEN the system SHALL support modular tool registration
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. IF new LLM models become available THEN the system SHALL support model switching without code changes
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments

An intelligent AI assistant designed to manage, monitor, and simplify your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment through natural language.

## About The Project

Managing AWS resources can be complex, often requiring deep knowledge of the AWS Management Console, CLI commands, or SDKs. The **AWS AI Concierge** aims to solve this problem by providing a conversational interface to your cloud infrastructure.

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate human language into actionable AWS API calls. Whether you're a developer needing to quickly spin up a test environment or a manager wanting a cost summary, the concierge is your go-to assistant for efficient cloud operations.

### Built With

This project is built with a modern, serverless architecture on AWS:

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed and configured:
* An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured on your machine.
* [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [AWS CDK v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/aws-ai-concierge.git](https://github.com/your-username/aws-ai-concierge.git)
    cd aws-ai-concierge
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    * _**(Note to developer: This section to be completed after POC)**_
    * Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` template and populate it with the necessary configuration, such as the Bedrock model ID or other service parameters.

5.  **Deploy the stack to your AWS account:**
    ```sh
    cdk deploy
    ```

## Usage

Once deployed, the concierge can be interacted with through a secure API endpoint.

> **Note:** This section will be completed with detailed examples and usage patterns once the initial Proof of Concept is validated.

## Roadmap

This project is currently in the Proof of Concept phase. Our vision includes:

-   [x] **Core POC:** Basic query engine for read-only actions (e.g., `describe`, `list`).
-   [ ] **Write Actions:** Add capabilities to create, update, and terminate resources.
-   [ ] **ChatOps Integration:** Connect the concierge to Slack or Microsoft Teams.
-   [ ] **Multi-Step Workflows:** Enable complex, chained commands (e.g., "Provision a new staging environment").
-   [ ] **Web UI:** Develop a simple user interface for easier interaction.
